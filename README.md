7. Hit next
8. You will now be presented with all fields in the table from the date you selected in the previous step. Ensure you look through the fields carefully and mark which fields should be treated as dimensions and which can be treated as measures. Hint) If you do not do this step correctly you could end up adding incorrect figures to your data model. When it doubt it is better to mark it as a measure
